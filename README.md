# Xchange

## A simple foreign currency exchange calculator

Xchange is a small PHP web application which allows you to convert from one specified currency 
to another. It can be a nice tool for people that deal with multiple foreign currencies.

The currency-conversion process depends highly on the relative **exchange rates** between the 
two currencies. Different entities (banks, forex bureaus, online forex services, etc...) have 
each got their own relative exchange rates between the various currencies they deal with. 
Because of this, Xchange has been designed to be installed on your own (or company's) server in 
order to take advantage of custom exchange rates. This means that you can specify your own 
exchange rates, for the different currencies, once the application has been installed on your 
server.

This application has been built using plain (custom) PHP, no frameworks. 

The project is meant to give a deeper understanding of how foreign currencies work 
behind-the scenes. It is also meant to test the OOP concepts of PHP.

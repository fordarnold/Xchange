# MODELS

These are PHP classes which represent the fundamental data held by the app.
Usually, models contain the different properties, and behaviours, of the
different *data entities*.

**For example:**  
A Model can represent a Country. Properties of a "Country" Model can be 
country name, zip code or co-ordinates.
